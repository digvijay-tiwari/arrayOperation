Find Maximum Subarray Sum: Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum. For example, given the array [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4], the contiguous subarray [4, -1, 2, 1] has the largest sum, which is 6.

Rotate Array: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is a non-negative integer. For example, given the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and k = 3, the rotated array should be [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4].

Merge Intervals: Given a collection of intervals, merge overlapping intervals. For example, given the intervals [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]], return [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]].

Two Sum: Given an array of integers and a target sum, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. For example, given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9, return [0, 1] (since nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9).

Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array: Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appears only once and return the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory. For example, given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4], return 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

Product of Array Except Self: Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1, return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i]. For example, given [1, 2, 3, 4], return [24, 12, 8, 6].

Trapping Rain Water: Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining. For example, given [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1], return 6 units of trapped water.

Find Missing Number: Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array. For example, given nums = [3,0,1], return 2.

Rotate Image: You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image. Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise). For example, given the following 3x3 matrix: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]].

Sort Colors: Given an array with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue. For example, given nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0], the function should sort nums in-place to [0,0,1,1,2,2].
